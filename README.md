Overview: Developed a Python-based framework for solving n-puzzle problems using advanced search and
heuristic algorithms.
Key Features:
• Implemented Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) for finding optimal solutions.
• Designed an A search algorithm* with multiple heuristic approaches, including Manhattan distance and
misplaced tiles.
• Integrated Gaschnig heuristic to enhance solution efficiency.
• Built a user interface using Tkinter to load and visualize puzzles from external files.
• Implemented functionality to check puzzle solvability based on grid properties.
